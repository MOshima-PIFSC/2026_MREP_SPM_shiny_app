### Definitions to get you started  

📈 **r (Population Growth Rate)** - the rate at which the size of a population can increase under ideal conditions (aka, no predators, unlimited food supply, unlimited habitat, etc.)

🌊 **K (Carrying Capacity)** - the maximum number of fish a habitat can support (based on how much food, space, etc. is available) 

**q (Catchability)** - how "catchable" a stock is 

🎣 **CPUE (Catch per unit Effort)** - the amount of fish caught relative to the amount of effort (aka hours spent fishing or number of hooks used) needed to catch that amount. CPUE is used to track changes in a fish stock's size. If you are catching less fish than you used to in the same amount of time, then this can mean the stock is going down.

🎯 **MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield)** - the most catch a fish population can support year after year without affecting future catches

🐠 **Bmsy (Biomass at Maximum Sustainable Yield)** - the total amount of fish needed to keep catching MSY

🪝 **Fmsy (Fishing Mortality at Maximum Sustainable Yield)** - the amount of fishing that gives you MSY. Fishing more than this will hurt future catches

🚨 **Overfished** - A population of fish that is too low

⚠️ **Overfishing** - The rate of fishing is too high to maintain a healthy population

> A population can be *overfished* but *overfishing* isn't occurring, or *overfishing* can be occurring but the population is not yet considered *overfished*. 

### Relevant Information on Species  

**Yellowfin Tuna (Ahi)**

Yellowfin Tuna, aka Ahi, are a highly mobile species. They can travel thousands of miles across the Pacific ocean to reach food and spawning grounds. Yellowfin Tuna grow fast and are relatively short-lived, they live about 6 to 7 years. Their populations increase at a moderate rate and because they are widely distributed across the Pacific, their populations are relatively resilient to fishing pressure. However, they do spawn in large aggregations which can make them vulnerable to fishing. Yellowfin tuna are considered epipelagic, meaning they are found in the open ocean up to about 100 m down.

**Mahi Mahi**  

Mahi Mahi are an extremely fast growing and maturing fish and can live about 4 to 5 years. Because of this "live fast, die young" strategy, their populations are highly resilient to fishing pressure and they can recover quickly from fishing pressure due to their fast growth, early maturation, and frequent spawning (multiple times a year). Mahi Mahi are typically found near the surface in tropical and subtropical waters of the open ocean.

**Opakapaka**  

Opakapaka are a relatively slow growing, long-lived species. They can live over 40 years and reach maturity around 2 years of age. Because of their slower development and longer life spans, their populations are more vulnerable to heavy fishing pressure and if the stock size is reduced, recovery can take much longer. Opakapaka are a deep-water, near shore bottomfish, found 

**Peacock Grouper** 

Peacock Grouper, aka Roi, are an invasive grouper found on many reefs around the Hawaiian Islands. Like many grouper species, Peacock Grouper are hermaphroditic, meaning at some point in their life they switch from a female to male. Because they carry a bacteria known as ciguatera, they cannot be fished and sold commercially. This lack of fishing pressure along with their status as a top predator on reefs, has allowed their populations to dominate many local reefs. Community efforts and fishing competitions can be one way to remove them from the reefs. 

**Yellowfin Goatfish (Weke 'Ula)**

Yellowfin Goatfish, aka Weke 'Ula, are a short-lived fast maturing, small, species. They only live up to about 5 years, and are highly resilient to fishing pressure. They can spawn throughout the year which helps to maintain their populations against fishing pressure. They are found in shallow sandy bottoms near reefs.
